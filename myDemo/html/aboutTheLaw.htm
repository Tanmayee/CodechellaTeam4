    				<p>ObamaCare, Obama Care and Health Care Reform are all the same thing. 
    					The official name for "ObamaCare" is the Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act, 
    					a bill signed into law to reform the health care industry.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li><p>Some aspects of Affordable health care reform are already enacted. 
    				The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed in 2010, 
    				and over 100 million Americans have already benefited from the new health care law.</p></li>
    			<li><p>Affordable Health care requires that all insurance plans cover preventive services and stops insurance companies
    				 from dropping you when you are sick, as well as offering a number of other reforms and protections.</p></li>
    			<li><p>Affordable HealthCare Act's insurance reform helps to insure millions of Americans each year. 48.6 million Americans went without insurance during all of 2011,
    				 compared to 49.9 million in 2010.
    				 The rate of uninsured decreased from 16.3% to 15.7%, the biggest percentage drop since 1999 due to the Affordable Care Act.</p></li>
    			<li><p>Affordable HealthCare allows newly insured Americans to choose any available participating primary care provider, OB-GYN, or pediatrician in their health plan’s network,
    				 or emergency care outside of the plan’s network, without a referral.</p></li>
    			<li><p>The Affordable HealthCare Act doesn't just focus on insurance, it also reforms the parts of the healthcare system that aren't working,
    				 or are costing the tax payer money. For example, by focusing on preventive measures instead of just treatment,
    				 Affordable HealthCare will save tens of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives.</p></li>
    			<li><p>19 million Americans will receive tax credits to help pay for healthcare 
    				and most middle class Americans will actually save thousands on healthcare via tax cuts.</p></li>
    			<li><p>If an you or your family chooses not to purchase healthcare through the Online Health Insurance Exchange,
    				 they can still buy private insurance, get insurance through their employer, Medicare, or Medicaid.
    				  Those who chose to not purchase insurance will pay an income "penalty" tax to help cover the rest of us.
    				 In other words, it's a tax, not a mandate; no one is actually forcing you to have health insurance.</p></li><br />
